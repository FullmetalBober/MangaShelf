<p><b>Manga</b> (Japanese: 漫画 [maŋga]) are comics or graphic novels
    originating from Japan. Most manga conform to a style developed in Japan in
    the late 19th century, and the form has a long prehistory in earlier
    Japanese art. The term manga is used in Japan to refer to both comics and
    cartooning. Outside of Japan, the word is typically used to refer to comics
    originally published in the country.

<p>In Japan, people of all ages and walks of life read manga. The medium
    includes works in a broad range of genres: action, adventure, business and
    commerce, comedy, detective, drama, historical, horror, mystery, romance,
    science fiction and fantasy, erotica (hentai and ecchi), sports and games,
    and suspense, among others. Many manga are translated into other languages.

<p>Since the 1950s, manga has become an increasingly major part of the Japanese
    publishing industry. By 1995, the manga market in Japan was valued at
    ¥586.4 billion ($6–7 billion),with annual sales of 1.9 billion manga
    books and manga magazines in Japan (equivalent to 15 issues per person).
    In 2020 Japan's manga market value hit a new record of ¥612.6 billion due to
    the fast growth of digital manga sales as well as increase of print
    sales. Manga have also gained a significant worldwide
    audience. Beginning with the late 2010s manga started massively
    outselling American comics. In 2020 the North American manga market was
    valued at almost $250 million. According to NPD BookScan manga made up
    76% of overall comics and graphic novel sales in the US in 2021. The
    fast growth of the North American manga market has been attributed to
    manga's wide availability on digital reading apps, book retailer chains such
    as Barnes & Noble and online retailers such as Amazon as well as the
    increased streaming of anime. According to Jean-Marie Bouissou,
    manga represented 38% of the French comics market in 2005. This is
    equivalent to approximately 3 times that of the United States and was valued
    at about €460 million ($640 million). In Europe and the Middle East, the
    market was valued at $250 million in 2012.
